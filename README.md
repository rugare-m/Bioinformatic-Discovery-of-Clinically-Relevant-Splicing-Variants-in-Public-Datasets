# Bioinformatic Discovery of Clinically Relevant Splicing Variants in Public Datasets

### Background
This work was done as part of a 3-month internship at Guy's and St Thomas Hospital's Genomics Innovation Unit (GUI) in London. The project was supervised by  Dr Ali Raza Awan, the GUI lead. 

### Abstract
Approximately 80% of ‘rare’ diseases have a genetic component. Genetic testing is routinely used to try and diagnose rare diseases. Variants of Uncertain Significance are variants of which there is conflicting, or no evidence for pathogenic or benign classification. These variants make up 50% of all variants described in the ClinVar database. Resolving VUSs may hold information that can help diagnose rare diseases. The aim of this project was to develop a computational pipeline to characterise the effects that VUSs have on transcript splicing isoforms and expression levels.
