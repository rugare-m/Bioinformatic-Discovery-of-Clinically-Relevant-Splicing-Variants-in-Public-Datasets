# Bioinformatic Discovery of Clinically Relevant Splicing Variants in Public Datasets

Approximately 80% of ‘rare’ diseases have a genetic component. Genetic testing is routinely used to try and diagnose rare diseases. Variants of Uncertain Significance are variants of which there is conflicting, or no evidence for pathogenic or benign classification. These variants make up 50% of all variants described in the ClinVar database. Resolving VUSs may hold information that can help diagnose rare diseases. The aim of this project was to develop a computational pipeline to characterise the effects that VUSs have on transcript splicing isoforms and expression levels.
