# Bioinformatic Discovery of Clinically Relevant Splicing Variants in Public Datasets

Approximately 80% of ‘rare’ diseases have a genetic component. Genetic testing is routinely used to try and diagnosis rare diseases. Synonymous variants are often overlooked compared to variants with obvious consequences on protein production. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) contains
